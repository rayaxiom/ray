Setting up the environment I'm comfortable with.
The only things not here is my .vim folder and .ssh/config.

.vim because I have not read up on submodules yet.
.ssh/config because I don't want people to know my usernames and servers.

## Tour...
bin/ is where all the binary files are kept.
dotfiles/ stores more than just dotfiles. It stores crontabs and .vim (eventually) as well.
dotfiles_old/ where old files are stored. Not that if INSTALL is ran more than once, then the original files in dotfiles_old will be deleted and replaced with symlinks... make a copy of dotfiles_old if you are worried.
hooks/ Stores the hooks for ths project. INSTALL will create symlinks to them from .git/hooks/
log/ used to store log files.
templates/ templates I use often.
