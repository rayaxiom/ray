Setting up the environment I'm comfortable with.
The only things not here is my .vim folder and .ssh/config.

.vim because I have not read up on submodules yet.
.ssh/config because I don't want people to know my usernames and servers.

bin/ is where all the binary files are kept.
dotfiles/ stores more than just dotfiles. It stores crontabs and .vim (eventually) as well.
