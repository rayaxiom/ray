config folder:
These are my openbox config files.
They are located in

~/.config/openbox/

So symlinks needs to be made for them.

##

bin folder:
These are binaries associated with openbox.

#
setlayout
First need this lib:
sudo apt-get install libx11-dev
gcc setlayout.c -o setlayout -lX11


For some retarded reason, we cannot use autostart. This is due to Lubuntu 
being awkward. So we do this:
Preferences->Default applications for LXSessions->Autostart
and input this:

"/home/ray/ray/openbox/bin/setlayout 0 2 3 0"

Done.
