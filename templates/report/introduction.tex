Navier-Stokes equations represent a mathematical model for incompressible fluid flow. Numerical solution of this system by the finite element method (FEM) require the use of mixed methods. In this context, the choice of the velocity and pressure is not independent of each other, as the pairs of the approximation spaces need to satisfy the discrete inf-sup stability condition. The inf-sup stable combinations of approximation spaces lead to a discrete Navier-Stokes problem which has an indefinite coefficient matrix. This fact, together with a usual ill-conditioness of the coefficient matrix, makes the solution of such system difficult, when using either direct or iterative methods. There exist a number of effective preconditioning techniques for efficient iterative solution of discrete Navier-Stokes equations (for example, the least square commutator (LSC) preconditioner, the pressure convection-diffusion (PCD) preconditioner, the augmented Lagrangian preconditioner). The main ingredients of a Navier-Stokes preconditioner are the efficient method for the approximation of the pressure Schur complement, and the efficient method for the approximate solution of the scalar diffusion and the convection-diffusion problems. The Schur complement approximation method is reflected in the name of a preconditioner (LSC, PCD). The approximate solution of the discrete diffusion/convection-diffusion problem is achieved by small, fixed number of multigrid V-cycles. Then the action of an inverse of a preconditioner to a vector is achieved by a block upper triangular update.OOMPHLIB (see http://www.oomphlib.org/) is a parallel, object-oriented, multiphysics finite element library implemented in C++. It includes a large number of examples in structural and fluid mechanics, as well as multiphysics problems in fluid-structure interaction. It implements a state-of-the-art numerical methodology for parallel numerical simulation of physical systems using a fully coupled discretisation by the FEM, adaptive time stepping methods and efficient preconditioned iterative solvers. The LSC preconditioner is already implemented within OOMPHLIB's parallel preconditiong framework. Comprehensive testing reveal the deterioration in preconditiner efficiency when applied to the systems obtained from triangular/tetrahedral elements and the systems that arise in FEM discretisation of problems with the inflow/outflow boundary conditions.The aim of this project is to implement within the OOMPHLIB's parallel preconditioning framework the recently developed modified versions of the LSC/PCD preconditioners that address the above issues. The efficiency of the modified preconditioners will be compared agains the old versions on a range of realistic fluid flow problems.~\cite{duffy}
